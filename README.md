# TNBC-single-cell-markers
Reproducible code for identifying TIL-based markers from single-cell RNA-seq data of TNBC patients

### Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype often marked by resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), making treatment particularly challenging. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have emerged as important predictors of treatment response, but existing signatures often lack resolution and cross-platform validation. Here, we develop and validate a novel, multi-cohort 80-gene TIL-specific transcriptional signature derived from pre-treatment single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This signature effectively captures the functional state of immune-infiltrated tumors, enabling stratification of tumors by TIL abundance and immune activation status at a single-cell level. Pathway analysis of the signature further revealed a strong enrichment of immune-regulatory pathways, particularly allograft rejection, indicative of adaptive immune activation. Extensive validation across both single-cell and bulk expression datasets showed that the signature is significantly associated with favorable response and relapse-free survival. Using a robust multi-stage feature selection pipeline, we refined this 80-gene panel to a 30-gene predictive subset. Binary classification models trained on this subset demonstrated high predictive performance in distinguishing patients who achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) from those with residual disease (RD) across nine independent TNBC cohorts (N = 704) encompassing a diverse range of microarray platforms, clinical endpoints, and sample sizes, achieving mean mean sensitivity = 0.71 (±0.13), specificity = 0.78 (±0.13), AUROC = 0.75 (±0.07), F1 score = 0.70 (±0.11), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) = 0.47 (±0.15), and overall accuracy = 0.74 (±0.08). Network analysis further identified a core module of 10 consensus hub genes, including CD8A, LCK, and CTLA4, central to T cell receptor signaling and the adaptive immune system. These genes were significantly overexpressed in responders across multiple datasets. Collectively, our study highlights an immunologically active tumor subpopulation associated with treatment sensitivity and provides a cross-platform-validated biomarker panel for patient stratification and therapeutic targeting in TNBC.
